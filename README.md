### 2-bookloadcover.lua
Replaces the information message when opening a book with the book cover. (The patch uses the cache from coverimage.koplugin. I recommend increasing the cache size in the `Settings` - `Screen` - `Cover Image` - `Cache Settings`)

### 2-keep-previous-screen.lua
Disables the information message when opening a book. (Not compatible with 2-bookloadcover.lua)

### 2-pb_native_dialogs.lua
**For PocketBook devices only.** Changes the appearance of information messages and dialogs to the native PocketBook design
